# AsBigAs
A javascript library that returns comparisons for length, height, area, volume, and weight.

"type_of_thing" can be:
- person
- animal
- plant
- automobile
- plane
- planet
- city

"measurement" for "length" or "height" JSON can be:
- "foot"
- "inch"
- "mile"
- "nautical_mile"
- "league"
- "nanometer"
- "milimeter"
- "centimeter"
- "meter"
- "kilometer"
- "light-year"

"measurement" for "area" JSON can be one of the above in unit^2

"measurement" for "volumne" JSON can be one of the above in unit^3


"measurement" for "weight" JSON can be:
- to-do
- to-do
- to-do
- to-do
